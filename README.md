# 🫧 Bubble Game Jam 2025 - "Bubbles and the Fury" 🫧

Welcome to **Bubbles and the Fury**, a game developed over **2 intense days of non-stop coding** for the **2025 Global Game Jam**!  
This year’s theme was **“Bubbles”**, and we dove deep into a whimsical, action-packed world where survival depends on your bubble’s wits and agility.

## 🎮 Game Concept

In *Bubbles and the Fury*, you play as a sentient bubble navigating a surreal and chaotic realm filled with enemies, hazards, and time-based challenges. Your bubble’s powers are limited—but clever movement and timely dodging are your only chances to survive the fury.

##  Technologies Used

- **Unity** (URP)
- **C#** (game logic and mechanics)
- **HLSL/ShaderLab** (custom shaders for effects)
- **Unity Animator** and **Timeline** (for cinematic and motion design)
